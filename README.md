  <h1>My name is Renz</h1>
    <p>My name is Renz and I would love to interact with you guys and I am currently a student learning how to be a frontend developer, one of my inspiration on coding is sir @Bryllim because of him I became more focused on coding and learning.</p>

  <h2>What I love doing</h2>
  <p>I love learning new things and trying it out on my own, coding is something I want to do in my whole life and these are some things I love doing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing online games</li>
      <li>Participating in coding conferences</li>
      <li>Searching and learning something new through the internet</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Although I stopped playing games already because it became a distraction to my learning progress, but sometimes I do play but only a bit.</p>
